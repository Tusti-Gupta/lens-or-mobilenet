            <p> According to our study, google lens is more reliable for image identification.
                <br><br>
                However as far as I know, mobile net
                can easily be co-ordinated in websites. It is available for free and does not require too complex code writing. Even so,
                according to google, it is only 70% accurate. Based on our case study, only 1/5 results were correct which is 20% accuracy.
                Hence, in business or other serious website development projects with economic investments, mobile net might not be a good 
                option.
                <br><br>
                Google lens is not available for use in websites easily. The api is hard to use in code. It is available as Google Cloud 
                Vision API. But this api is not free. But if someone is willing to invest some money, then google lens is the best option. 
                It is super accurate because it uses google's dataset. Even in our study, it was 100% accurate.
